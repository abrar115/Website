    "title": "Electric Charges and Fields",
    "summary": "This chapter introduces the fundamental concepts of electric charges, Coulomb's law, electric fields, and Gauss's law. It explains how charges interact, the nature of electric fields, and how to calculate them for different charge distributions. Key topics include conservation and quantization of charge, superposition principle, electric dipoles, and electric field lines.",
